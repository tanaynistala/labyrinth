# Project Proposal Title

Iris Yang, Stephanie Wilson, and Tanay Nistala

## Introduction

The introduction should describe the problem (in a non-technical manner, i.e., without math, equations, etc.), as well as motivate the problem, i.e., why is it important?

## Background Related Work

Following, you should provide the necessary background and discuss related work in the RL literature. This section should also be about a page. Citations should be in BibTeX format [2].

## Technical Approach / Methodology / Theoretical Framework

Describe how you will approach the problem and its technical formulation. Feel free to re-state the basic RL formulas (e.g., if using Q-learning, state the update rule or the formula for what the Q function approximates).

### Tasks

Subsections are useful for breaking down the problem into sub-parts. For example, you could break down the tasks for your project and list them one by one.

## Evaluation

Describe how you will evaluate your approach/solution. What constitutes success? What metrics will you use? Do you have any preliminary hypothesis that you plan to test? Also, describe the RL domain or environment you plan to use.

## Timeline and Individual Responsibilities

State the timeline in terms of weeks and milestones you want to achieve. If working on a team, state what the individual responsibilities are at this point (i.e., who is going to do what, these may of course change over the course of the project). [1].
