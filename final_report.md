\section{Introduction}

%The introduction should describe the problem (in a non-technical manner, i.e., without math, equations, etc.), as well as motivate the problem, i.e., why is it important?

In the field of robotics, maze solution by a robot is an interesting challenge because of the localization and path finding algorithms used to perform it. This specific application of path finding and localization can be used for finding the best ways for a robot to navigate a space efficiently and safely, and has been used for the development of many path finding algorithms. Dynamic robot path finding that adapts to obstacles in surroundings can be used for many useful tasks for robots, like finding its way through unknown areas of people or difficult terrain. Robots that conduct tours, scout out areas unreachable by people, and map out terrain can all use algorithms like these to gather information more effectively. 


We propose to test several different established methods of localization and path finding of a Turtlebot simulation on different mazes that we generate. This will require fine-tuning of said methods to allow the Turtlebot to expertly navigate the mazes, and we will compare how fast they are able to localize and navigate the maze. Our results will provide more insight into how robots map out unknown areas, hopefully leading to future advancements in localization and path-finding algorithms.

\section{Technical Approach / Methodology / Theoretical Framework}

% for proposal
%Describe how you will approach the problem and its technical formulation. Feel free to re-state the basic RL formulas (e.g., if using Q-learning, state the update rule or the formula for what the Q function approximates). 

\subsection{SLAM}
SLAM, or \textbf{S}imultaneous \textbf{L}ocalization \textbf{a}nd \textbf{M}apping, allows robots to keep track of their surroundings as well as their specific location on the map. SLAM usually consists of two elements: a tool to observe the environment and measure around the distance from it, like LiDAR or sonar, and software that extracts and identifies the objects in the area that it is mapping out.  
\\
We are using the SLAM algorithms directly provided to us in ROS. ROS provides us with several different SLAM algorithm implementations, including: Gmapping, Hector, and Karto. The mathematical details of these are shown below: 
\\\\(insert math equations)
\\\\ Gmapping operates by using laser scan/odometry data to learn maps at runtime. It separates positioning and mapping processes and scans the area that is in front of it to map the area as it moves. 
\\
\indent Hector leverages both LiDAR and 2D pose estimates, uses odometry for mapping and localization. Hector will fail if the odometry fails, which makes it more failure prone than the other algorithms. Due to this unreliability of Hector, we will be using it during experiments, but not without caution. 
\\
\indent Karto uses odometry, but unlike Hector, doesnâ€™t fail when odometry fails. This makes it a more reliable version of Hector, and a comparison area against Gmapping.
